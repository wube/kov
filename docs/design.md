# Kov design

Kov is a C++-like language with a new compiler built around one idea: **no includes at the
deepest level of how the compiler works**, so that builds are orders of magnitude faster.
Original proposal: https://github.com/wube/kov (language changes in the README,
compilation model in `compilation/index.md`).

This file records decisions that have been made. When a decision changes, update it here.

## Decided

### 1. A native compiler, not a layer over Clang
- Our own front end (lexer, parser, name/type resolution, template instantiation, constexpr
  interpreter). LLVM is used only as the code generation backend.
- Rejected: Clang fork, or a build driver that generates C++20 modules / includes behind
  the scenes. Clang's declare-before-use, one-file-one-thread model cannot deliver the goal.

### 2. Compilation model
- **No `#include`, no forward declarations.** Every project symbol is visible everywhere.
  The project is a set of files (a "scope expansion path"), not an include graph.
- **Order-independent.** Declaration order does not matter (except runtime static
  initialization order within a file). Circular dependencies that cannot be resolved
  (e.g. type A contains B by value and B contains A) are reported as errors.
- **One multithreaded compiler process** sharing one symbol table, instead of independent
  per-file processes:
  1. Index: parse all files in parallel, build the global symbol tree, record unresolved
     references, keep function bodies.
  2. Resolve: once everything is indexed, resolve references and types.
  3. Codegen: with sizes and the full tree known, generate code. No separate link step.
- **Each template instantiation is generated exactly once** (reuse / wait for the thread
  producing it / produce it).
- **Persistent compiler.** It stays running with the program model in memory, recompiles
  precisely what changed, and serves IDE queries.
- Macros: global macros (command line / declared global, cannot be `#undef`ed) and
  file-local macros.

Expected limit: once headers and duplicate instantiations are gone, LLVM optimization
dominates release builds. The big wins are debug builds and incremental rebuilds; release
builds win less unless machine code is cached per function.

### 3. Simple templates
- Templates are for generic types and functions (`Vector<T>`, `max<T>`), not a
  metaprogramming language.
- Kept: type and value parameters, variadic parameters, full specialization,
  `if constexpr`, constraints written as plain conditions (`requires`-like).
- Dropped: SFINAE / `enable_if` tricks, template metaprogramming as computation,
  `typename` / `template` disambiguators.
- Compile-time computation is done with ordinary constexpr code run by an interpreter.
- Factorio survey: almost no SFINAE (2 `enable_if`, 1 `void_t`), but 593 full
  specializations, plus `if constexpr`, `requires` and variadics, so those stay.

### 4. Our own standard library
- No C++ std. A smaller, saner library written in Kov: one UTF-8 `String` with small-string
  optimization (no traits/char-type/allocator template parameters; allocators passed at
  runtime), Vector, SmallVector, HashMap, Optional, Span, UniquePtr, Function, formatting,
  sorting, file/OS wrappers. No iostreams.
- Factorio's in-house containers (FlatMap, SmallVector, TinyVector, IntrusiveList...) are
  the starting point.

### 5. Interop: C only
- Import C headers / C ABI (OS APIs, SDL, Lua, zlib, openssl, curl...).
- C++ libraries (glm, imgui, tracy, re2, Steam SDK...) get a thin C wrapper or a port.

### 6. Language changes from the proposal (not yet scheduled)
Real enum class with methods/str()/iteration, `this` as a reference, required `this->`,
required `override`, explicit by default (`implicit` keyword), no implicit switch
fallthrough, exhaustive enum switches (abort on invalid value), typed union, `?->`, `?:`,
`both_const` / `class_const`, named parameters, test tools in the compiler, `accumulate`
methods (the Factorio survey suggests generating save/load from the class may beat it).

## Benchmark target

Factorio: ~1.3M lines of own C++ in ~8,000 files (~1.6M with tests). Today's full rebuild
including tests is about 2-4 minutes with unity builds (100 files/unit), PCH and FASTBuild.
A 10x win means ~12-24 s for a full build. The key metric is also the rebuild time after a
one-line change in a widely used header.

## Open questions
- **Syntax must be parseable without name lookup.** C++ needs to know whether a name is a type
  or a template to parse `a * b;` or `f < a > (b)`. In the index-then-resolve model the parser
  runs before any name is known, so Kov should make these cases unambiguous by grammar
  (candidates: a different template-argument bracket or a required disambiguation, no
  most-vexing-parse, declaration statements recognisable from their first tokens). The prototype
  parser uses heuristics that work on 99.2% of Factorio files; the resolver can flag misparses
  later, but a real compiler should not have to guess.
- **Macros.** Everything the prototype could not parse or resolve in Factorio comes from macros
  (`CALL_ON_EVERY_*` code generation, assert macros, enum wrappers). Kov needs a replacement for
  the code-generation uses (compile-time reflection / `accumulate`-style features) before the
  converter can drop them.

## Roadmap
1. **Speed-test prototype** (done, see [prototype-results.md](prototype-results.md)): parallel
   lexer + parser + order-independent name resolution, benchmarked on Factorio. Whole front end
   in 0.32 s for 1.33 M lines on 32 threads. No code generation.
2. Compiler that runs real Kov programs via LLVM.
3. Standard library, C import, converter from Factorio-style C++ to Kov.
4. Persistent compiler + IDE integration.
